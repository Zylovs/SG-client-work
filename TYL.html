     <h3>Where do I even start ?</h3>

    <p> Back in September of 2021 I was in an RP server, first one I ever joined too. I had already been in there for a month so I was getting the gist of what RP is 

        all about and what's expected. During that small amount of time I met some people that I now consider my best friends. I saw what an amazing group of 

        people was involved in this community, but there was something that just wasn't there for me. That one thing is passion for the people. When it 

        comes to building a community the #1 thing that matters most, is all of you. I remember back in September briefly mentioning to one whom I now 

        consider my best friend Boon that I was going to make my own server. We both were excited and threw out crazy ideas, but it never really went past that.

         A couple more months past and in December Habibi purchased a game host for me to give it a shot, but man did I have NO clue how hard it was to start a FiveM server. 

         I definitely have more respect for FiveM devs now than I did back then. After messing around for a couple weeks I honestly gave up. It was far to great a challenge 

         for one man to tackle so I just went back to my normal RP routine. As more time went on I saw these people I had met start to dwindle down to just a couple. 

         People were leaving to go to other community's because they no longer felt heard. They felt as if they had no voice and they didn't matter. That's when I knew 

         that it was time. I had to get some amazing like-minded people together with the same views and visions and really kick this thing off. 

         So I spoke with Wearzy, Campbell, Greg, and Gaines to see what they thought of the idea. As you all see now, they were absolutely stoked. 

         So we kick started this thing we call Summit Gaming. Now that the rambling is over I can get to what this is all about. This is the Founders page. 

         Any name you see above this are the people that were here from day 1, the people that helped kickstart this entire thing. The people that I honestly can't 

         thank enough. Even all of you, the community members. Thank you for giving us all of these amazing ideas because without those we would have a basic qb-core server.

          Without you guys there would be no RP. There wouldn't be a foundation to build upon. I truly can't thank you people enough. I promise so long as Summit Gaming is 

          here we will always listen and value your opinions and suggestions. We will ALWAYS listen even if you feel like it's no big deal. No matter what, this is OUR 

          community.</p> <br><br> <p>Buns, I honestly don't know what I would have done without you. The amount of time you saved my ass by fixing a bug that I couldn't find or all the

           projects you took on just to give me a break or even buy me more time to work on other things. Even all those times when I am caught being lazy you tell me to 

           get up and get on some of the bug reports or to get in the class to learn more Lua. If it wasn't for you we would still be a month out from testing so for that,

         I thank you. </p><br><br> <p> Habibi, what would we do without that emotional support man. Honestly though, thank you for being the first person to financially provide for this 

         community. Without your contributions back in December, I would have never learned how to do this. We would be miles behind if it wasn't for that. So for all of this,

        I thank you.</p> <br><br> <p> Perseus, Where do I start with you man. Without you half of the scripts wouldn't even exist. Every time the server needed something you never hesitated 

        once to pull through and provide just that. On top of it, you've invested in the Lua class with me and buns to learn how to script just to help out even more. 

        Even with all of this you constantly look for things to do or things you can fix for the community. Talk about going above and beyond. Thank you bud, honestly.

       </p> <br><br> <p> Gaines, thank you for always keeping me in check when I am getting to frustrated/mad. Especially when I can't figure out a bug or issue with a script lol. 

        Thank you for being the voice of reason when things get heated and most importantly, thank you for picking up where I slack off. You've went absolutely above and 

        beyond on EUP, Vehicle, and server dev. Thank you man, it means more than you know.</p> <br><br> <p>Wearzy, I remember when you told me that you could website dev and I was 

        absolutely shocked. You took it upon yourself and volunteered to create an absolutely stunning website from SCRATCH and I couldn't have asked for anything better. 

        You have absolutely exceeded my expectations and you've even stepped up on server dev, AND running EMS. You constantly come up with amazing ideas and keep the 

        imagination flowing in this community. Thank you bud, I don't know what i'd do without you man. </p> <br><br> <p> Campbell, Oh man I could go on and on. Just like gaines, you're 

        the voice of reason when we all could use a good smack in the head. You're one of the most level-headed people I've ever met . In all the times when I am stressed

         and need to vent you're always there. You were the one who kickstarted EUP for us and paved the way for clothing. Now that you've done that, you're getting with me

          to learn how to Develop on the server. You're just an overall amazing guy and I just wanted to thank you for being apart of this community. And don't get me 

          started on that voice.....lol.</p> <br><br> <p> McQueen, if you told me McQueen would be the Summit Gaming Head Admin I would say you’re crazy….THE McQueen being here? 

          Nah……Well I was mistaken. When I tell you that I could have jumped out of my chair for joy when I heard you were coming over here I mean it. 

          You have helped kick start the entire staff team and have been the foundation to what is now going to be the best staff on FiveM. Thank you for 

          going above and beyond for this community and thank you for never hesitating when it comes to supporting us. I’m glad we got my favorite staff member 

          to work with to be in charge of this communities staff team. </p><br><br> <p> Stapes, man when I tell you that you’re the backbone of the SADPS I mean it bud. 90% of 

          the PD stuff wouldn’t be here without you. The amount of testing you did for the SADPS helped get it to where it is now. Your financial support has been 

          absolutely insane and the cars that you provided this community are a HUGE hit with the members. Thank you for being passionate about this community and

           thank you for always being motivated to make it better each day.</p> <br><br> <p>Boon, the first guy I ever spoke to about starting a community. I know we both never thought

            this day would come, but we did it man. We actually did it. Thank you for always believing me and being a guy that I will ALWAYS call my best friend. 

            Thank you for always being the guy that I can literally talk to about anything. And most of all, thank you for believing me. 

            Without you there to keep me sane I wouldn’t have been able to focus on the community and the work that needs to be done. 

            Thank you for always taking initiative to get things done and always being the first to volunteer when things need tested. Thank you brother, 

            I’ll never forget the heart and soul you put into this.</p> <br><br> <p> Gimes, I know me writing this is gonna have you in my ear saying "aww Cheesil does love me"
             and I am prepared to hear it for the rest of my days because you deserve recognition for the work you've done. Even though we disagree sometimes you always do
              what's best for the community and you have a passion to build something great and we all see that. You're an absolute asset to this community and I just wanted 
              to thank you for putting in the countless hours to get all the cars balanced and working flawlessly. Without you we would be MONTHS behind schedule and I wouldn't
               be able to do it. You do valuable work and we as a community appreciate it more than you know. Thanks bud.</p> <br><br> <p>To the remaining developers. 

             Thank you for all the hard work you put in each and every day to make this community a better place. Without you this would not be possible. 

             You guys take so much work off of me and I will forever be grateful. You guys make this community enjoyable for all of us players and you never hesitate 

             to jump on the next task even after working for hours and hours.</p>
